<h2> Join us as a participant!</h2>

The Poldrack Lab is recruiting volunteers for studies of how cognitive control, memory, and decision-making work in the brain. These studies involve up to 20 experimental sessions lasting up to three hours each. During each session, you will be scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging and/or perform computerized or paper and pencil behavioral tasks and questionnaires. You may also be asked to respond to daily prompts on an app regarding your menstrual cycle and your sleep schedule. If you do not have a menstrual cycle, you may respond to only the prompts about your sleep schedule. After the scanning session, you may be asked to provide a saliva sample. You may be excluded for irregular menstrual cycles.

Eligible participants must have a minimum of an 8th grade education, speak English fluently, be right-handed, and have no history of significant medical illnesses including cardiovascular disease, cancer, immunodeficiency disorders (such as HIV infection), diabetes, unstable endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, neuromuscular disorders, or blood dyscrasias; additionally, participants must not have experienced head trauma with loss of consciousness, cerebrovascular accident, seizures, or neurosurgical interventions, and should have no history of major psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), substance dependence, the use of medication for psychiatric reasons, or a clinical diagnosis of major depression.

Eligible participants will be compensated up to $20/hour for participation, and may have the opportunity to earn bonuses up to $400. If asked to respond to our cell-phone based app prompts on your sleep and menstrual cycles, participants will be paid $1 per day for answering the 3 daily questions. Participants may receive an additional bonus up to $100 for completing a high proportion of these daily questions.
